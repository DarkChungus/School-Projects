Alright so here, we only got 2 projects, and that's because for the last term(semester), we do not have any project. The first project work
I got this year was a DBMS project work(that is why it is in the .rar format), I had to make a school system in the DBMS itself so I put a
lot of effort into it. The second project is a file handling project in QBASIC, where my actual laptop held me down. Because of my laptop, I
could not properly run QBASIC graphics code, and so I had to constantly make calculated guesses as to where the actual graphics will be
located and where the text will be.
