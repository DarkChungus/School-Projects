Alright so, if you aren't up to date with the Nepali time periods, you may be confused as to why it says "IT Exhibition 2081". Well,
it's currently 2025 A.D, but in Nepal, it's 2081 B.S. With that out of the way, I want to explain what is actually going on here. Every
year, our school hosts a Science and IT Exhibition, that will give the students a chance to show off all the project that they have been
working on. Last year, I participated, but I only got to know that I can actually use programmming languages other than QBASIC around a week
before the actual exhibition, so I had to pull out a lazy, low-effort snake game made in Python using TKinter. That is the reason why, I got
only a certificate of participation. This year, however, to avoid the mistakes of last year, I have been working on my project before I even
got into Grade 10. There are a few projects, and the C project(algorithm visualizer) I worked on with a friend of mine, otherwise, the rest
of them I did solo. I hope to win first place with these(especially the fourier transform, knowing how much it is used in the current world),
and that this will be a lifetime memory.
